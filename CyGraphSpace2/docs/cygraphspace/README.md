# Overview

CyGraphSpace allows users to upload graphs and their styles directly from the Cytoscape app to GraphSpace without manual intervention thus enabling a Cytoscape user to seamlessly share their networks on the web via GraphSpace. A user can also quickly import GraphSpace graphs into Cytoscape, analyze them with other Cytoscape apps, possibly make modifications, and then re-upload them to GraphSpace using CyGraphSpace.
